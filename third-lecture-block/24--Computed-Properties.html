    <!--
        Second counter which increase another property.

    -->
    <button v-on:click="secondCounter++">Increase Second</button>
    <p>{{ counter }} <-> {{ secondCounter }}</p>
    <!-- We call not a property but a function -->
    <p>Result: {{ result() }}</p>
    <!--
        BUT HERE we call output not like a function but like a property. Output is Computed value.

        For computed properties VueJS analyze does it need to be re-rendered somewhere or not.
        What does it mean? It means that if we click Increase or Decrease buttons - we will not only increase counter,
        But also a recalculation of computed value. Why? Because we use this property in computed value calculation.
        You could check it in console log

        But we don't use secondCounter in computed values and that's why VueJS doesn't call output value-method and doesn't raise additional log in console.

        USAGE:
            use result() if you know that you don't want to cache the result and you want to recalculate again and again every time when DOM gets updated
            in other cases better to use computed values

    <p>Result 2: {{ result() }} <-> {{ output }}</p>
